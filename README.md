# Human Resource Management (HRM) System

## Overview

This Human Resource Management (HRM) System is a modular microservices-based application designed to streamline HR operations within an organization. The system is developed following Clean Architecture principles with Java and Spring Boot, supporting scalability, maintainability, and testability.

## Architecture

The system follows a **modular monolith to microservices-ready** approach with clearly defined modules:

* **Domain**: Core business logic and entities
* **Application**: Use cases and service interfaces
* **Infrastructure**: External systems (databases, messaging, etc.)
* **API**: REST endpoints for external interaction

## Tech Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot
* Maven (Multi-module)
* PostgreSQL / MySQL
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Clean Architecture

## Core Modules & Features

### 2. Attendance Management

## Development Guidelines

* Follow Clean Architecture: Domain -> Application -> Infrastructure -> API
* Use DTOs and Mappers to isolate layers
* Prefer constructor injection and immutability
